# How to communicate

* When working in a team it is important to communicate problems and improvements
* Which ways did you already use for this?
    * Chat-programs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Email lists <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Issue tracking on e.g. github <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Issuing

* Central place for all issues related to a project
* Offers a place for discussing the issue
    * Closely tied to the repository
    * All past issues can be (re)viewed
* All people subscribed will get notifications for new issues
