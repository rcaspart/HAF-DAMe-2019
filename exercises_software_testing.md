# Hands-on time

* Our project already includes some unit tests
* Check the current test coverage (you might also check your coding style with [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))


	$ coverage run my_unit_test.py arg1 arg2
	$ coverage report
	# For nicer reports you can use
	$ coverage html

# Your tasks

* Add unit tests for the features you added on your branch before
* The current set of unit tests does not cover all cases
    * Can you think of anything else that needs testing?
    * You can find a list of possible test cases in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-cases)
    * *Hint* look at the output of the coverage
    * Add corresponding unit tests

# Your tasks (2)

* Challenge other workshop participants with an improved coverage score
	* Team up with another mate to get even higher scores
* Share your unit tests
